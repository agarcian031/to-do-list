### Overview: 

In this program, we are using JavaScript to be able to create a beautiful and functional **to-do list** with an interactive UI in which the user can add items to the list, remove items from the list, or check off items that have been completed from the list. 

The user's to-do list is stored in the local storage, so when he refreshes the page, he can always find the list there.

There is the possibility for the user, to clear the list, by clicking the button clear, at the top right corner of our app.

The to do list app, shows the today's date to the user, for that we're using a method called toLocaleDateString
